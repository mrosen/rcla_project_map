need which is to provide safe water for drinking and sanitation to their new community. The objectives of this
project are to separately meter 160 homes, provide safely filtered water to those homes, assist COCODE and
the local municipality with the installation of a water filtration system and holding tanks (one holding, one
sedimentation) provide initial training in system maintenance, and assist the village in setting up a billing
surcharge system to add to the San Lucas Toliman municipal distribution of water that is chlorinated but not
filtered for pathogens. A secondary goal will be to initially train locals on sanitation and use of safe water and
have the local doctor and hospital adopt a measurement system to identify whether or not there are measurable
health benefits from safe water. Dr. Paul Wise of Stanford (CV uploaded under Participants) developed the
measurement system, and Dr. Rafael Tun of Hospital Obras Sociales Monsignor Gregorio Schaffer (hereinafter
